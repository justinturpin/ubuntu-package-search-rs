<h2>About</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>This is just a search engine for Ubuntu Packages.</p>

<h3>Why did you make this?</h3>

<p>Because I feel like the official Ubuntu package search is kind of bad. I really like the
Alpine Linux package search and wished that Ubuntu had something like it, so I made it. Also
I wanted to learn Rust.</p>

<h3>What is this made in?</h3>

<p>Rust, using Gotham and Rusqlite.</p>
